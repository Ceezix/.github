## What is Ceezix?

Ceezix is a modular AI-driven development platform — not a single app, but a growing ecosystem of intelligent systems built for developers who move fast and build differently.

It is engineered around three principles:

- **Automation first** — every repetitive workflow is a candidate for elimination
- **Modular by design** — each system is independently deployable, composable at scale
- **Intelligence at the core** — AI is not a feature, it is the foundation

Built inside a real Termux / mobile dev environment. Every component is tested under actual constraints — no sandboxed ideal conditions.

---

## Architecture

```
ceezix/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          → Express backend — AI services, automation logic, REST APIs
│   └── web/          → React (Vite) — developer-facing interface and dashboards
├── packages/
│   ├── core/         → Shared logic, utilities, AI abstractions
│   └── config/       → Unified configuration layer
└── tools/            → CLI utilities, build scripts, network tooling
```

A monorepo structure managed with PNPM workspaces. Each `apps/` module runs independently. Shared logic lives in `packages/` and is consumed without duplication.

## Core Capabilities

| Domain | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI Systems** | Inference pipelines, prompt engineering layers, model integrations |
| **Automation** | Workflow engines, scheduled task runners, event-driven triggers |
| **API Layer** | RESTful services with structured response contracts and auth |
| **Dev Tooling** | CLI utilities, scaffolding tools, environment configuration |
| **Network Optimization** | Custom scripting layer for bandwidth, routing, and performance |

## Featured Modules

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### ⚡ API Engine
`ceezix-api`

The backend core. Handles all AI service routing, automation job execution, and external integrations. Built on Express with a structured middleware pipeline.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🖥️ UI Dashboard
`ceezix-web`

React interface for monitoring, configuration, and interacting with Ceezix systems. Built with Vite for instant feedback loops during development.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🌐 Network Engine
`ceezix-net`

Low-level network tooling and optimization scripts. DNS, bandwidth management, connection profiling — built for real environments, not ideal ones.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🧠 AI Core
`ceezix-core`

The intelligence layer. Abstractions over AI models, prompt lifecycle management, response parsing, and context handling across all Ceezix modules.

## Tech Stack

```
Runtime       →  Node.js
Backend       →  Express.js
Frontend      →  React + Vite
Package Mgr   →  PNPM (workspaces)
Language      →  JavaScript (ES Modules)
Environment   →  Termux · Linux · Mobile-native
```

## Live System Mindset

Ceezix is built in production-equivalent conditions from day one.

- **Real environment** — developed on Termux, tested on constrained hardware
- **Performance-optimized** — no bloat, no unnecessary dependencies
- **Horizontally scalable** — modules can be extracted, replicated, or replaced
- **Zero tolerance for technical debt** — architecture decisions are made to last

This is not a prototype. It is a platform.

---

## Vision

```
2025  →  Core platform (API + Web + AI layer)
2026  →  Automation ecosystem, CLI suite, network tooling
2027  →  Mobile overlays, AI terminal OS, distributed agent framework
```

The end goal: a fully autonomous developer environment where Ceezix handles orchestration, optimization, and execution — so the engineer focuses on architecture, not operations.
